#### Draft/Keeper Rules
###### Draft Settings
- Draft Type: Offline, Regular (non-snake)
- Draft Date: To be scheduled by the league manager
- Location: To be scheduled by the league manager

###### Draft Order
The draft order is determined by the previous season. The champion is the last slot, the runner up is the second to last slot, third place is the third to last slot, the fourth place team is the fourth to last slot, and the rest of the teamsâ€™ slots are determined by the reverse regular season standings. 

Expansion teams are given the top slots in the draft. If there is more than one expansion team, the top slots are assigned randomly.

###### Keepers
A maximum of 5 players may be kept for the next season. The following conditions must be met in order to keep a player:
1. The player must have been drafted or acquired no later than the keeper deadline in the previous season (8/31).
1. The player must be drafted in an earlier round than the year before (i.e. if a player was drafted in the 10th round in 2015 and kept for 2016, he must be drafted in the 9th round or earlier in 2016). 
   - If a player was picked up in free agency, then he shall be drafted in the 22nd round (or earlier). 
   - If a player was drafted, dropped, and then picked up by another team, the original draft slot still applies if being kept by the other team.
1. The player must have been kept less than three times (a player may only be kept a maximum three times). For example, if a player was acquired in 2012, he may be kept in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
   - Keeper years transfer through trades. The number of years kept is only reset when the player reenters the draft.

###### Pre-Draft Trades
Draft picks and keepers may be traded in the offseason in the time between when the keepers lock (a week before the draft) and the draft. Note that draft picks must balance and that if a team trades a keeper, that team will not gain another keeper slot to use on another player from the previous year.
